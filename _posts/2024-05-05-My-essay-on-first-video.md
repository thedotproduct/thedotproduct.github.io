## Introduction

Welcome to my first blog post on my journey into deep learning! I am currently exploring the fascinating world of language models and their applications in personal productivity. As a learner, I am diving deep into the "Neural Network Z to H" video series by Andrej Karpathy, which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ). These videos are a treasure trove of knowledge, and I am meticulously working through them, chapter by chapter.

As I navigate these resources, I frequently encounter challenging concepts and find myself reflecting on many "why" questions. This blog serves as a space to document these queries and my thoughts, providing a roadmap for others who might face similar hurdles.

The goal of these essays is to assist others who encounter the same questions and obstacles in their learning journey. I am leveraging ChatGPT to assist with note-taking, generating questions, and coding challenges. Moreover, the content of this blog is refined with the help of a custom ChatGPT persona, ensuring clarity and depth. Join me as we decode the complexities of deep learning together!
