Classification is a type of supervised learning in machine learning, where the goal is to predict a categorical or discrete output variable based on one or more input features. In other words, classification algorithms learn from labeled training data to predict the class or category of a new observation based on its features.

For example, in a binary classification problem, the output variable has only two possible classes, such as spam or not spam, malignant or benign tumor, or fraud or not fraud. In multi-class classification, the output variable has more than two possible classes, such as image recognition or sentiment analysis.
