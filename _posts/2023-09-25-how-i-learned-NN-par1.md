Welcome to my website, where I embark on a journey to understand neural networks from the ground up. In this series of blog posts, I'll be sharing my insights and discoveries. 
My learning style is rooted in a "learn from first principles" approach, and I'll be adopting a "diagram first" writing style to help facilitate comprehension. 
Rest assured, I'll accompany explanations with code snippets, and I promise to keep the mathematics to a minimum. 
So, whether you're a beginner or an experienced enthusiast, let's delve into the world of neural networks together!
