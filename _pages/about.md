# Welcome to My Digital Corner
Hello, dear reader, and thank you for stopping by. If you've found your way here, you're likely someone with a keen interest in the evolving world of technology, just like me. My name is **Jairam**, and this space is a reflection of my journey through the intricate maze of data and distributed engineering, my explorations in **machine learning and GenAI**, and the occasional detour into the realms of leadership, productivity, and, of course, some cinematic adventures.

## Professional Journey
By profession, I am deeply entrenched in the world of distributed engineering and machine learning, working tirelessly with tools and technologies that shape the future of data processing and analysis. My expertise spans across:

1. **Distributed Engineering**: From orchestrating distributed data ingestion using Apache Spark to mastering the basics of Apache Kafka, 
                               and leveraging AWS Glue for efficient data migration and ETL processes. I have a knack for implementing Elastic Search 
                               to enhance search capabilities with a touch of fuzziness.
2. **Machine Learning & Analytics**: My canvas is tabular text data, and my art form is multiclass classification. Utilizing algorithms like SVM, RF, Xgboost, and Logistic Regression, 
                               I've delved deep into feature engineering, employing string similarity algorithms and innovations like ChatGPT, Tf-Idf, and BM25. 
                               My work in analytics extends to dashboard reporting on platforms such as Snowflake, Databricks, and AWS Redshift, 
                               where I empower teams to embrace data-driven decision-making.

   4. Algorithms: SVM, RF, Xgboost, Logistic Regression
   5. Feature Engineering: String Similarity Algorithms usage, implementation with the help of ChatGPT, Tf-Idf, BM25
   6. Analytics and Dashboard Reporting
      1. I Build and help the team to do the analytics and dashboarding on cloud warehouse like
         1. Snowflake
         2. Databricks
         3. AWS Redshift
      2. I Enable the team to think analytically, and do the data drive decisions.
3. GenAI
   1. Exploring the different areas like vectorDB, Local LLMs, LangChain, LLamaIndex
   2. Exploring RAG applications to Enterpise data
      1. Natural Language to Dashboarding
      2. Natural Languae to business insights to different stake holders
   3. Enterprise Search using LLMs may lead to customer 360 or C360 application for Enterprises.
